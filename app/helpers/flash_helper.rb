require 'action_view/helpers'

# Provides a helper method to simplify the display of flash messages and provide the
# necessary markup for the display framework to properly style them.
#
# Presently, Foundation is our display framework. Necessary format for Foundation framework:
# <div class="alert-box [success alert secondary]">
#   This is an alert box.
#   <a href="" class="close">&amp;times;</a>
# </div>
module FlashHelper
  # Allow for views and others to read the list of available flash message categories
  attr_reader :FLASH_KEYS

  # Acceptable flash message categories
  FLASH_KEYS = {
      alert:     :warning,
      notice:    :standard,
      info:      :info,
      secondary: :secondary,
      success:   :success,
      error:     :alert
  }

  # Returns the HTML for pretty display of the flash messages, either in full or for the categories specified.
  #
  # Parameters:
  #
  #   * `keys` - (optional) a subset of +FLASH_KEYS+ categories to display (defaults to all keys in +FLASH_KEYS+)
  #
  # Returns:
  #
  #   * An `html_safe`-ed string with the display markup for the selected categories of flash messages
